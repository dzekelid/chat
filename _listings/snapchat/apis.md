description: I would say Snapchat is one of the poster children for why API Activist
  exists. Snapchat is an extremely popular messaging platform, and should have APIs
  to provide access to its customer base. Each user should have API access using OAuth,
  on the Snapchat platform. Beyond just access Snapchat has had a history of security
  problems, that is another reason we encourage companies to be more public with their
  APIs. Snapchat does not see the value of APIs beyond its own needs, and will need
  some more convincing before they make the move to an open API program.
